    <div class="climate">Best Time to Visit Goa:</div><br>
    <div class="climate-para">Being a tourist hotspot, Goa can be visited at any time of the year, but the best time to
        visit Goa is from November to March,<br>during the winter months. During this time, the weather is dry and
        pleasant, with temperatures ranging between 20°C to 30°C<br>(68°F to 86°F). This makes it an ideal time to enjoy
        the beaches and water sports activities in Goa.<br><br>

        The monsoon season in Goa starts in June and lasts until September, bringing heavy rainfall to the region. While
        the rain<br>can make the scenery lush and green, it may also make it difficult to explore the region and enjoy
        outdoor activities. Many<br>of the beach shacks and restaurants may also be closed during this period.<br><br>

        The summer months from April to May can be hot and humid, with temperatures soaring up to 35°C (95°F). It may
        not be the<br>best time to visit if you're looking for a relaxing beach vacation, but it can be a good time to
        explore the region's culture<br>and history.<br><br>

        In summary, the best time to visit Goa is from November to March, during the winter months, when the weather is
        dry and pleasant,<br>and most of the beach shacks and restaurants are open.
